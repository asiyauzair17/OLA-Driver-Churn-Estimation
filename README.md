# OLA-Driver-Churn-Estimation
This project predicts Ola driver churn using 2019–2020 monthly data. It includes EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, KNN imputation, handling class imbalance, and ensemble models such as Bagging, Boosting (GBDT, XGBoost), and Stacking. Models are evaluated using classification metrics and AU-ROC curves to derive churn insights.
